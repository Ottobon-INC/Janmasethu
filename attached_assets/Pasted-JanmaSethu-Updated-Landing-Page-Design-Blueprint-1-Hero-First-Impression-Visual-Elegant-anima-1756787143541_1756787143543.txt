JanmaSethu – Updated Landing Page Design Blueprint
1. Hero (First Impression)

Visual: Elegant animated line morphs into couple → pregnancy → cradle.

Headline: “Bridge to Parenthood. For every step of the journey.”

CTA: “Meet Sakhi” (primary), “For Clinics” (secondary).

Effect: Cinematic line animation + soft glow.

2. About JanmaSethu (Who We Serve)

3 clean cards: Patients · Clinics · Investors.

Short Stripe-style one-liners.

Hover effect: glassmorphism lift.

3. 🌱 Parenthood Journey Strip (NEW Section)

Purpose: Show visitors the breadth of Sakhi’s coverage, without giving away all content.

Layout: Horizontal journey timeline, full-width.

Stages (icons + 1-liner):

🌱 Thinking of Parenthood → “Nutrition, emotional readiness, financial planning.”

💖 Trying Naturally → “Cycle tracking, lifestyle tips.”

🔬 Exploring Options (IUI/IVF) → “Preparedness checklists, questions for your doctor.”

🤰 Pregnancy → “Trimester guidance, myths vs facts.”

👶 Post-Delivery → “Recovery, newborn care, mental health.”

Interaction:

Line glows and “lights up” stage by stage on scroll.

Hover/tap reveals a tiny tooltip: “Sakhi guides you at this stage.”

CTA under strip: “See how Sakhi supports you →”

👉 This is the demo narrative: it signals to patients “we’re with you across the whole journey”, to clinics “we cover more than IVF”, and to investors “this framework is scalable.”
