Refactor the site header navigation so that on laptop/desktop viewports (≥1024px) only 4 main sections are always visible, and all other sections appear inside a “More” dropdown positioned before the search bar. On mobile (<1024px) the existing full menu/hamburger should still show all sections as one list (no “More”).

Requirements

Responsive behavior

Desktop (≥1024px): show 4 primary items, add More ▼ button, move other items into dropdown.

Mobile (<1024px): keep existing full nav list (no More split).

Dropdown behavior

“More” is a <button> (not link), with caret icon.

Clicking opens a menu (role="menu") with the hidden items as links (role="menuitem").

Close on ESC, click outside, or tabbing out.

Dropdown aligns under “More” button; prevent overflow if near right edge.

i18n support

Labels localized:

EN: “More”

HI: “और”

TE: “మరిన్ని”

All nav item labels also use existing localization (EN/HI/TE).

Accessibility

Button uses aria-haspopup="menu", aria-expanded toggle.

Focus moves to first item in dropdown when opened; returns to More button on close.

Keyboard navigation: Up/Down to cycle, Enter to select.

Styling

Match current nav style (spacing, font).

Dropdown: white background, subtle shadow, rounded corners, 8–12px item spacing.

Hover/active: light gradient or subtle highlight.

Keep nav alignment: Logo | 4 items | More ▼ | Search | Language toggle.

Config-driven

Maintain a config/array for nav items with { id, label:{en,hi,te}, href, priority }.

Render first 4 by priority as primary; rest into More dropdown.

Easy to re-order by editing priorities.

Acceptance criteria

Desktop: only 4 items visible, rest in More dropdown.

Mobile: all items in hamburger (no split).

Language toggle switches labels of both primary and More menu items.

Navigation works without errors; layout aligned with search + language toggle.
